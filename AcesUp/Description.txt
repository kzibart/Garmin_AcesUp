Aces Up!  A fun card game you can play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

The object of the game is to discard everything but the aces!  Cards are dealt into four stacks, and you can only discard a card if a same-suit, higher-value card is directly above it or at the bottom of another stack.  You can also move the bottom card of a stack to an empty stack, or use a wild card to discard any card from the bottom of a stack, except for an ace.  It sounds confusing, but it's really simple once you get the hang of it!

Before starting a new game, you can set your theme, suit colors, background color, and the nmber of wild cards you'll earn.  Then when you tap Start, you'll be ready to go!  Your first four cards will be dealt automatically.  Each round, you'll discard as many cards as you can, maybe move cards to empty slots, and then deal the next four cards.

Aces are automatically moved to the top of a stack when dealt out.  You just have to get them all up there, and clear everything else!  The game is over when the deck is empty and you either have just the four aces remaining across the top, or you don't have any moves left.  But if you do run out of moves, you can always tap the Undo button to go back and try something else!

Wild cards will appear below the deck as you earn them, after every 12 discards, up to the limit you set before starting the game.  To use one, tap it to highlight it.  The available cards to discard will also be highlighted.  Either tap one of them, or tap the wild again to cancel using it.

You can change the theme, suit colors, background colors, and the animation speed, or view game statistics, from the settings menu at any time.
